# Overview 
This folder consists of analysis programs written in Python that examine the influence of molecule structures on the dynamics of excited state electrons. 

Light-induced isomerization currently plays a key role in creating molecular switches / molecular machines, where light aids in conversion between different stable forms or configurations of a molecule. Applications can be seen in photoresponsive biological functions and processes in light-absorbing proteins such as vision, photosynthesis, and DNA repair.

This work tries to understand how the structure of [conjugated systems](https://tinyurl.com/ybrfmk4t), such as number & positions of double bonds, the sizeof the system/number of Carbons, etc., affect the photo-isomerization products of non-adiabatic processes, and the lifetime of excited states. Our work also look into whether the excited state dynamics localized on individual bonds, or delocalized on multiple bonds.
