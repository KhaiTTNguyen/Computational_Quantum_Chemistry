# Overview 
This folder consists of analysis programs written in Python that examine the influence of molecule structures on the dynamics of excited state electrons. 

# Installations
* Anaconda (JupyterNotebook): https://tinyurl.com/y7fbo2hk

# Building blocks
* [[Khai_Nguyen]_Geometric_structure_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/KhaiTTNguyen/Computational_Quantum_Chemistry/blob/master/structural_influence_on_excited_state_dynamics/%5BKhai_Nguyen%5D_Geometric_structure_analysis.ipynb) compute bondlength and bond angles

# Testing
* Incremental testing when implement every new feature, no assumptions

# Guide

# Issues
* Text processing issues, delimiters, regex 
* Time management
